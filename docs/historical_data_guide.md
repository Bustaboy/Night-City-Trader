Arasaka Neural-Net Trading Matrix: Historical Data Upload Guide
Version: 1.0
Date: June 14, 2025
Author: Grok 3, xAI
Purpose: Arm Chooms with the know-how to jack up to 20 years of crypto data into the Arasaka Neural-Net Trading Matrix to stack Eddies across bull, bear, and altcoin markets.
1. Introduction
The Arasaka Neural-Net Trading Matrix is a cyberpunk-fueled, AI-driven crypto bot wielding ML (XGBoost) and RL (DQN) to nail profitable trades. To max out Eurodollars, it needs historical OHLCV (Open, High, Low, Close, Volume) data to train across market regimes. Crypto kicked off with Bitcoin in 2009, so 20 years (back to 2005) is a stretch, but we can grab ~15 years for Bitcoin and less for altcoins, with simulated data as backup.
This guide shows how to source, download, and upload data into the bot’s SQLite database (local_trading.db) using scripts/import_historical_data.py and market/data_fetcher.py. It’s wired for the bot’s setup, including the historical_data table and training pipelines, keeping things GUI-based—no console jacking required, Choom!
2. Data Requirements
Goal: Load 15–16 years of OHLCV data (2010–2025) for major pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT) to train ML/RL models for bull, bear, and altcoin markets.

Granularity: Hourly (1h), per config.yaml. Minute data is optional for pro Netrunners.

Pairs: High-volume USDT pairs (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT, BNB/USDT, ADA/USDT) on Binance.

Storage: historical_data table with columns: symbol, timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume.

Format: CSV files with columns: timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume.

Volume: ~100,000–500,000 rows per pair for hourly data over 15 years.

3. Data Sources

4. Step-by-Step Data Upload
Jack into the Net and follow these steps when you’re ready to upload data into the Matrix.
4.1 Prepare the Environment
Verify Setup: Ensure code is live, including core/database.py, market/data_fetcher.py, scripts/import_historical_data.py.

Create Data Folder: Set up a CSV stash in your project root.

Check Dependencies: Confirm pandas and sqlite3 are installed via requirements.txt.

Initialize Database: Run scripts/setup_database.py to create the historical_data table.

4.2 Download Historical Data
CryptoDataDownload:
Hit https://www.cryptodatadownload.com, go to “Data”.

Grab hourly CSVs for BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT (e.g., Binance_BTCUSDT_hourly.csv).

Save to data/historical/.

Example format:

timestamp,open,high,low,close,volume
1417411200000,300.0,310.0,295.0,305.0,100.0

CoinAPI (Optional):
Sign up at https://www.coinapi.io, buy a plan or data package.

Export OHLCV for BTC/USDT (since 2010) via API or UI.

Save as CSV to data/historical/, matching columns (timestamp in milliseconds).

Sample API call:
python

import requests
api_key = "YOUR_COINAPI_KEY"
response = requests.get(
    "https://rest.coinapi.io/v1/ohlcv/BINANCE_SPOT_BTC_USDT/history",
    params={"period_id": "1HRS", "time_start": "2010-01-01T00:00:00", "limit": 100000},
    headers={"X-CoinAPI-Key": api_key}
)
data = response.json()
# Save as CSV

Kaggle (Optional):
Download from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sudalairajkumar/cryptocurrency-historical-prices.

Clean CSVs to match: timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume.

Save to data/historical/.

Bitget (Optional):
Grab BTC/USDT CSVs (since 2018) from Bitget’s data section.

Save to data/historical/.

4.3 Import Data into SQLite
Run Import Script:
Execute scripts/import_historical_data.py to load CSVs.

It scans data/historical/, extracts symbols (e.g., BTCUSDT), converts timestamps, and inserts data with INSERT OR REPLACE.

Check trading.log:

2025-06-14 11:37:00 - INFO - Imported 100000 records for binance:BTCUSDT from Binance_BTCUSDT_hourly.csv

Verify Import:
Check DB size (expect ~100MB+ for multiple pairs).

Query (optional, SQLite client):
sql

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM historical_data WHERE symbol = 'binance:BTCUSDT';

Run a GUI backtest in “Netrunner’s Dashboard”.

4.4 Train Models
Trigger Training:
Launch the GUI with gui/main.py.

Hit Train Neural-Net to retrain ML and RL models.

Trainers (ml/trainer.py, ml/rl_trainer.py) use historical_data for indicators, seasonality, and regimes.

Logs in trading.log:

2025-06-14 11:37:00 - INFO - Model saved to ml/model.pkl
2025-06-14 11:37:00 - INFO - RL model saved to ml/rl_model.h5

Validate:
Run a backtest via Run Backtest.

Check equity curve in “Netrunner’s Dashboard”.

4.5 Test the Bot
Testnet Mode:
Enable testnet in the GUI to keep Eddies safe.

Trade to confirm historical data drives predictions.

Monitor:
Use Refresh Portfolio for trade/position tracking.

Scan trading.log for issues.

5. Optimizing for Large Datasets
Handle ~15 years of data like a pro Netrunner:
Database Indexing:
historical_data’s primary key (symbol, timestamp) is solid. For speed, add:
sql

CREATE INDEX idx_symbol ON historical_data(symbol);

Update core/database.py’s init_tables.

Batch Processing:
For big CSVs (>1M rows), mod import_historical_data.py:
python

def import_historical_data(data_dir="data/historical"):
    for filename in os.listdir(data_dir):
        if filename.endswith(".csv"):
            filepath = os.path.join(data_dir, filename)
            symbol = filename.split("_")[1].replace(".csv", "")
            df = pd.read_csv(filepath)
            batch_size = 1000
            for i in range(0, len(df), batch_size):
                batch = df.iloc[i:i+batch_size]
                db.executemany(
                    """
                    INSERT OR REPLACE INTO historical_data
                    (symbol, timestamp, open, high, low, close, volume)
                    VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
                    """,
                    [(symbol, int(row["timestamp"]), row["open"], row["high"],
                      row["low"], row["close"], row["volume"]) for _, row in batch.iterrows()]
                )
                db.conn.commit()
            logger.info(f"Imported {len(df)} records for {symbol}")

Data Compression:
SQLite may hit ~1GB. Archive pre-2015 data or explore Parquet (needs code changes).

Memory:
Training needs ~8GB RAM. If tight, cut settings.ML["batch_size"] in config.yaml (1000 → 500).

6. Handling Limitations
20-Year Gap:
Crypto starts 2009, so 15 years max for Bitcoin, less for altcoins (ETH since 2015).

simulate_ohlcv fakes older data, but use sparingly:
python

def simulate_ohlcv(self, limit):
    timestamps = pd.date_range(end=pd.Timestamp.now(), periods=limit, freq="1h").astype(int) // 10**6
    close = np.random.normal(60000, 1000, limit).cumsum()
    data = [[ts, c * 0.99, c * 1.01, c * 0.98, c, 100] for ts, c in zip(timestamps, close)]
    logger.warning("Returning simulated OHLCV")
    return data

Pair Availability:
Altcoins (ADA, SOL) start ~2017. Focus on BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT.

PairSelector filters by volume/liquidity.

API Limits:
CoinAPI/Binance throttle requests. enableRateLimit=True helps, but CSVs are king.

7. Future-Proofing Updates
Keep the Matrix fresh:
Auto-Updates:
DataFetcher.preload_historical_data grabs new data on startup.

Schedule daily via cron/Task Scheduler.

Real-Time:
fetch_ohlcv pulls live Binance data into historical_data.

Set settings.TESTNET=False for live action.

Cleaning:
Monitor trading.log for data glitches.

Run cleanup:
python

def clean_historical_data():
    db.execute_query("DELETE FROM historical_data WHERE open IS NULL OR close <= 0")
    logger.info("Cleaned historical data")

8. Troubleshooting
Import Errors:
Check trading.log (e.g., missing columns).

Verify CSV format.

Database Size:
If local_trading.db bloats, split by exchange or archive old data.

Training Crashes:
Lower settings.ML["historical_data_years"] to 10 or batch_size.

Check RAM/disk space.

API Hiccups:
Verify CoinAPI keys.

Fallback to CryptoDataDownload.

9. Optional Enhancements
Future upgrades for when you jack back in:
Parquet Storage:
Use pyarrow for compressed storage.

Tweak import_historical_data.py for Parquet.

Cloud Sync:
Back up local_training.db to AWS RDS.

Update core/database.py for remote DBs.

Validation:
Add checks in import_historical_data.py:
python

def validate_data(df):
    if df["close"].isnull().any() or (df["close"] <= 0).any():
        raise ValueError("Invalid data: Null or negative prices")
    return df

Incremental Fetch:
Mod DataFetcher.fetch_historical_data to grab only new data.
