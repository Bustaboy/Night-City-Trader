Arasaka Neural-Net Trading Matrix
Jack into the Net and Stack Eddies with AI-Driven Crypto Trading!
Welcome to the Arasaka Neural-Net Trading Matrix, a cyberpunk-charged crypto trading bot that runs locally, trading on Binance (testnet or live) to rake in Eurodollars (profits). Fueled by ML (XGBoost) and GPU-accelerated RL (DQN), this daemon crunches 15+ years of data, real-time signals, and 20+ profit-pumping features to own bull, bear, and altcoin markets. Its neon-lit GUI makes it a breeze for Chooms (users) of all levels—no console needed!

Sentiment & On-Chain Edge: Pulls vibes from CryptoPanic, X posts, and Glassnode whale moves.

Arasaka Risk Protocols: Dynamic leverage (1x–3x), Kelly sizing, and ATR-based stop-loss/take-profit.

Strategies Galore: Breakout, mean reversion, and multi-timeframe analysis for any market regime.

Portfolio Optimization: Rebalances with Modern Portfolio Theory for max Sharpe ratio.

Netrunner's Dashboard: Neon GUI to trade, train, backtest, and track Eddies.

Add Binance API keys (testnet/live): https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/how-to-create-api-keys-on-binance

Optional: CryptoPanic, TradingView, Glassnode keys for extra signals.

Initialize Database:
Run scripts/setup_database.py via GUI Python runner (e.g., VS Code’s “Run Python File”).

Start the API:
Launch api/app.py with a GUI runner or:
bash

uvicorn api.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

Run the GUI:
Fire up gui/main.py for the Netrunner's Dashboard.

Option 2: Use Installer
Download:
Snag TradingBotSetup.exe from GitHub Releases.

Install:
Run installer, follow prompts.

Launch:
Open via desktop shortcut or Start menu.
