Arasaka Neural-Net Trading Matrix
Jack into the Net and Stack Eddies with AI-Driven Crypto Trading!
Welcome to the Arasaka Neural-Net Trading Matrix, a cyberpunk-fueled, single-user crypto trading bot that runs locally on your rig, trading on Binance (testnet or live) to churn Eurodollars (profits). Powered by cutting-edge ML (XGBoost) and GPU-accelerated RL (DQN), this daemon leverages 15+ years of historical data, real-time market signals, and 20+ profit-pumping features to dominate bull, bear, and altcoin markets. With a neon-lit GUI, it’s built for Chooms (users) of all levels—no console jacking needed!
Features
Neural-Net Trading: ML and RL models predict trades with GPU-accelerated precision, trained on up to 15 years of OHLCV data.

Dynamic Pair Selection: Auto-picks high-volume, trending pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT) using volume spikes, volatility, and liquidity.

Arbitrage Hustle: Snipes cross-exchange and triangular arbitrage for low-risk Eddies.

Sentiment & On-Chain Edge: Taps CryptoPanic, X posts, and Glassnode for market vibe and whale moves.

Risk Protocols: Arasaka-grade risk management with adaptive leverage (1x–3x), Kelly Criterion sizing, and ATR-based stop-loss/take-profit.

Strategies Galore: Breakout, mean reversion, and multi-timeframe analysis for every market regime (bull, bear, altcoin).

Portfolio Optimization: Rebalances positions using Modern Portfolio Theory to max Sharpe ratio.

Netrunner’s Dashboard: Neon GUI to trade, train models, backtest strategies, and monitor Eddies in real-time.

Emergency Kill Switch: Halts all trading faster than a Militech raid.

Testnet/Live Toggle: Swap modes via GUI to test without risking Eurodollars.

Setup
Jack into the Matrix with these steps. No console? Use the GUI and GitHub’s web UI, Choom!
Option 1: Run from Source
Clone the Repo:
Grab the code: https://github.com/your-username/neural-net-local

Download as ZIP or fork it on GitHub.

Set Up Python:
Install Python 3.10: https://www.python.org/downloads

Create a virtual env (optional, use Anaconda’s GUI if console’s down):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

Install Dependencies:
Open requirements.txt and install via a GUI package manager (e.g., Anaconda Navigator) or:

pip install -r requirements.txt

For GPU acceleration (optional):
Install CUDA 11.8: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive

Install cuDNN 8.6: https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn

Verify: Check trading.log for GPU available: True after training.

Configure .env:
Copy .env.example to .env.

Add your Binance API keys (testnet or live): https://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/how-to-create-api-keys-on-binance

Optional: Add CryptoPanic, TradingView, Glassnode keys for sentiment and on-chain analytics.

Initialize Database:
Run scripts/setup_database.py via a GUI Python runner (e.g., VS Code’s “Run Python File”).

Start the API:
Launch api/app.py with a GUI runner or:

uvicorn api.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

Run the GUI:
Fire up gui/main.py to enter the Netrunner’s Dashboard.

Option 2: Use Installer
Download:
Grab TradingBotSetup.exe from the GitHub Releases page.

Install:
Run the installer, follow prompts to deploy the Matrix.

Launch:
Open via desktop shortcut or Start menu.

Configure:
Edit .env in the install directory with Binance API keys.

Initialize DB and run GUI as above.

Usage
GUI Controls:
Scan Optimal Pair: Auto-selects trending pairs based on volume spikes and RL predictions.

Buy/Sell: Stack Eddies with dynamic leverage and adaptive SL/TP.

Risk Profile: Choose Conservative, Moderate, or Aggressive Arasaka Protocols.

Testnet Toggle: Swap between testnet and live in the GUI.

Train Neural-Net: Retrain ML/RL models on historical data.

Netrunner’s Dashboard: Monitor trades, backtest strategies, and check sentiment/on-chain signals.

Emergency Kill Switch: Stop all trading if the Net gets too hot.

Data Prep:
Import 15+ years of OHLCV data (see docs/historical_data_guide.md).

Sources: CryptoDataDownload (free), CoinAPI (paid).

Risk Management:
Adaptive leverage (1x–3x), Kelly sizing, and portfolio optimization keep drawdowns low.

Test with small amounts on testnet first, Choom!

System Requirements
CPU: Dual-core 2.0 GHz (quad-core 3.0 GHz+ recommended).

RAM: 8 GB (16 GB+ for large datasets).

Storage: 10 GB free (50 GB SSD for historical data).

OS: Windows 10/11, macOS 12+, Linux (Ubuntu 20.04+).

Python: 3.9–3.11 (3.10 recommended).

GPU (Optional): NVIDIA GTX 1060+ with CUDA 11.8, cuDNN 8.6 for RL training.

Network: Stable 10 Mbps+ broadband for API calls.

Notes
Testnet First: Run on Binance testnet to avoid burning Eddies.

Data Import: Follow docs/historical_data_guide.md to load historical data for max accuracy.

GPU Boost: Enable CUDA for 5–10x faster RL training (check trading.log).

Logs & Alerts: Monitor trading.log and GUI popups for Arasaka-grade insights.

Stay Jacked: Ensure Net connectivity for Binance, CryptoPanic, and Glassnode APIs.

Building the Executable
To package the Matrix as a single executable:
Install PyInstaller:

pip install pyinstaller

Run:

pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --add-data "config;config" --add-data "ml;ml" --add-data "trading.log;." gui/main.py

Create an installer with Inno Setup using dist/main.exe.

Stack Eddies, Choom!
The Arasaka Neural-Net Trading Matrix is your ticket to dominating the crypto Net. Jack in, train the Neural-Net, and watch Eurodollars pile up. Got issues? Ping your AI Fixer on the Net. Stay jacked, Choom!
