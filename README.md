Arasaka Neural-Net Trading Matrix
Jack into the Net and Stack Eddies with AI-Driven Crypto Trading!
Welcome to the Arasaka Neural-Net Trading Matrix, a cyberpunk-charged crypto trading bot that runs locally, trading on Binance (testnet or legacy) to rake in Eurodollars (profits). Fueled by ML (XGBoost) and GPU-accelerated RL (DQN), this daemon crunches 15+ years of data, real-time signals, and 20+ profit-pumping features to own bull, bear, and altcoin markets. Its neon-lit GUI makes it a breeze for Chooms (users) of all levels—no console needed!

Features
Neural-Net Trading powered by ML and RL with GPU-accelerated precision, trained on up to 15 years of crypto data.

Dynamic Pair Selection snipes trending pairs (BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT) using volume spikes and liquidity.

Arbitrage Hustle grabs cross-exchange and triangular arbitrage for low-risk Eddies.

Sentiment & Network Edge pulls vibes from CryptoPanic, X posts, and Glassnode wallet moves.

Arasaka Risk Protocols with dynamic leverage (1x–3x), Kelly sizing, and ATR-based stop-loss/take-profit.

Strategies Galore: breakout, mean reversion, multi-timeframe analysis for any market.

Portfolio Optimization rebalances with Modern Portfolio Theory for max Sharpe ratio.

Netrunner's Dashboard: neon GUI to trade, train, backtest, and track Eddies.

Emergency Kill Switch halts trading faster than a Militech raid.

Testnet/Live Toggle swaps modes in the GUI for risk-free testing.

Setup
Jack into the Matrix with these steps. Console fried? Use the GUI and GitHub’s web UI, Choom!
Option 1: Run from Source
Clone the Repo
Grab it: http://github.com/your-username/neural-net-local

Download ZIP or fork on GitHub.

Set Up Python
Install Python 3.10: http://www.python.org/downloads

pip install -r requirements.txt

For GPU boost:
CUDA 11.8: http://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-8-0-download-archive

cuDNN 8.6: http://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn

Check trading.log for GPU available: True after training.

Configure .env
Copy .env.example to .env.

Add Binance keys (testnet/demo): http://www.binance.com/en/support/faq/how-to-create-api-keys

Optional: CryptoPanic, Bitget, Glassnode keys for signals.

Initialize Database
Run scripts/setup_database.py via GUI Python runner (e.g., VS Code’s Run Python File).

Start the API
Launch api/app.py with GUI runner or:
uvicorn api.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000

Run the GUI
